Numerical code for geometric probability problems, in particular P\-D\-Fs, C\-D\-Fs, means and variances for the \char`\"{}line picking\char`\"{} problem.\-The problem is a standard problem in stochastic geometry, where we pick lines at random from some region. The typical questions one asks are\-: what will the mean line length be? What will the Probability Density Function (P\-D\-F) be? This software implements the current list of known P\-D\-Fs, C\-D\-Fs, means and variances for such problems. It also provides solutions to some previously unsolved problems.

The code has been designed to provide a small set of entry points which are callable from R, Matlab and C. The documentation is found in the files for their respective help systems.

Much of this manual is dedicated to documenting functions specific to a particular problem but users of the software will only need to call the entry points documented in

A simple method for seamlessly extending the library has been provided.
