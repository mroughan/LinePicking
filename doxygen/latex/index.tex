Numerical code for geometric probability problems, in particular P\-D\-Fs, C\-D\-Fs, means and variances for the \char`\"{}line picking\char`\"{} problem.\-The problem is a standard problem in stochastic geometry, where we pick lines at random from some region. The typical questions one asks are\-: what will the mean line length be? What will the Probability Density Function (P\-D\-F) be? This software implements the current list of known P\-D\-Fs, C\-D\-Fs, means and variances for such problems. It also provides solutions to some previously unsolved problems.

The library has been designed to provide a small set of entry points which are callable from R, Matlab and other C programs. Documentation for the R and Matlab bindings to this libary have been provided in the a format suitable for each of their help systems.

Much of this manual is dedicated to documenting functions specific to a particular problem but users of the library generally only need to understand the entry points documented in the \hyperlink{group__api}{Line\-Picking A\-P\-I}.

A simple method for seamlessly extending the library has been provided and is also documented in the \hyperlink{group__api}{Line\-Picking A\-P\-I}.
