\subsection{Sphere-line picking}
\label{sec:sphere_line}

Sphere-line picking is subtly different from ball-line picking. In
this new case, we choose points on the surface of a 2-sphere (the
sphere in 3D), but the lines are straight lines in the 3D space in
which the sphere is embedded, i.e., we use the standard Euclidean
distance metric.
