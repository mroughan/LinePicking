     abstract = {The integral of the title equals the mean distance mk from the origin of a point uniformly distributed over the k-dimensional unit hypercube Ik. Closed form expressions are given for k = 1, 2 and 3, while for general $k, m_k \simeq (k/3)^{1/2}$ . Using interalia methods from geometry, Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities and Taylor series expansions, several inequalities and an asymptotic series for mk are established. The Taylor series method also yields a slowly convergent infinite series for mk and can be applied to more general problems including the mean distance between two points independently distributed at random in Ik.},
