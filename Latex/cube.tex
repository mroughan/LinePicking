\subsection{Cube-line picking and related generalizations}
\label{sec:cube_line}

These results have also been extended into 3D, with the probability
density function of distances between two (uniformly) randomly chosen
points in the unit cube is given in
\cite{mathai99:_distan,weisstein:_cube_line_picking}, by a yet more
complicated, but again easily evaluated formula. Likewise the formula
have been calculated for a box (with sides $a,b$ and
$c$)~\cite{philip:_probab_distr_distan_between_two} and 4- and
5-Cubes~\cite{philip:_probab_distr_distan_between_two_4d}. Other
results are also known, for instance the distribution when the points
are chosen on the sides of the square (but lines are drawn across it)
or faces of a cube!\cite{mathai99:_distan}, and the distribution of
distances between points chosen in two different
rectangles~\cite{b.ghosh51:_random_rect}.

Maybe too complicated to write here???

Box and 4- and 5-cubes definitely are


\subsubsection{CDF}


\subsubsection{Moments}

The mean for the cube, known as the {\em Robbins constant}, is given
in \cite{robbins78:_constant,weisstein:_cube_line_picking,Bailey2007196} as
\begin{equation}
   \label{eq:cube_mean}
 \mu^{\rm cube} = \frac{1}{105} \left[ 
                             4 + 17 \sqrt{2}- 6 \sqrt{3}  +
                             21 \ln(1+\sqrt{2}) + 
                             42 \ln(2+\sqrt{3}) - 7 \pi
                      \right]
	= 0.6617071822...
\end{equation}
but a closed form for the variance does not appear (only even moments
are reported). Even more complicated results appear for 4- and
5-Cubes~\cite{anderssen76:_concer,philip:_probab_distr_distan_between_two_4d,Bailey2007196}:
\begin{eqnarray}
 \mu^{\rm 4-cube}  & = & 0.7776656535 ...    \label{eq:4-cube-mean}, \\
 \mu^{\rm 5-cube}  & = & 0.8785309152 ...     \label{eq:5-cube-mean}, \\
 \mu^{\rm 6-cube}  & = & 0.96895 ...     \label{eq:6-cube-mean}, \\
 \mu^{\rm 7-cube}  & = & 1.05159 ...     \label{eq:7-cube-mean}, \\
 \mu^{\rm 8-cube}  & = & 1.12817 ...     \label{eq:8-cube-mean}, \\
 \mu^{\rm 9-cube}  & = & 1.19985 ...     \label{eq:9-cube-mean}, \\
 \mu^{\rm 10-cube} & = & 1.26748 ...     \label{eq:10-cube-mean}.
\end{eqnarray}

Higher order moments are considered as {\em box integrals} in
\cite{Bailey2007196}. 
% http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377042706004250

The basic notion is to write the moment as an integral
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:moment_n_cube}
  \Delta_n(s) = \int_0^1 \cdots \int_0^1
        \left[ \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2 \right]^{s/2}
        \, dx_1 \ldots  dx_n   \, dy_1 \ldots  dy_n  
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the dimension, and $s$ the moment in
question. Bailey~{\em et al.}~\cite{Bailey2007196} present methods to
evaluate the integral to high precision, though without an analytic
expression for the result, except for first moments. 

% The ability, however, to derive these to high precision presents the
% ability to calculate the moment generating function of the $n$-cube
% distances to high precision, and thence by numerical inversion (of the
% Laplace transform used to obtain the MGF). 



The paper notes high-dimensional approximations have been studied ...



However, the second moment is not difficult, because for $s=2$ the box
integral reduces to 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:moment_n_cube}
  \Delta_n(s) = \int_0^1 \cdots \int_0^1
        \left[ \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2 \right]
        \, dx_1 \ldots  dx_n   \, dy_1 \ldots  dy_n  
\end{equation}

Alternatively, we can see that for the $n$-cube
\begin{equation}
  E\left[ D^2 \right]
           = E\left[ \left( \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2} \right)^2 \right]
           = \sum_{i=1}^n E\left[ D_i^2 \right]
           = n  m_2^{\rm line}
           = \frac{n}{6}.
\end{equation}
The mean distance for the $n$ cube is known to satisfy~\cite{anderssen76:_concer,weisstein:_cube_line_picking} 
\begin{equation}
  \frac{n}{9} \leq \left( \mu^{n-\mbox{cube}} \right)^2
                    \leq  \frac{n}{18} 
                               \left[ 1 + 2 \left(1-\frac{3}{5n}\right)^{1/2} \right]
                        ,
\end{equation}
so the variance $\sigma^2_n = \frac{n}{6} - \left( \mu^{n-\mbox{cube}}
\right)^2$ can be calculated to be 
\begin{equation}
  \frac{2n}{18}\left[ 1 - 2 \left(1-\frac{3}{5n}\right)^{1/2} \right]
        \leq \sigma^2_n
        \leq \frac{n}{18}.
\end{equation}
