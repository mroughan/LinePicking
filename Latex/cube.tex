The mean for the cube, known as the {\em Robbins constant}, is given
in \cite{robbins78:_constant,weisstein:_cube_line_picking} as
\begin{equation}
   \label{eq:cube_mean}
 \mu^{\rm cube} = \frac{1}{105} \left[ 
                             4 + 17 \sqrt{2}- 6 \sqrt{3}  +
                             21 \ln(1+\sqrt{2}) + 
                             42 \ln(2+\sqrt{3}) - 7 \pi
                      \right]
	=	0.66170...
\end{equation}
but a closed form for the variance does not appear (only even moments
are reported). Even more complicated results appear for 4- and 5-Cubes in
5-Cubes~\cite{philip:_probab_distr_distan_between_two_4d}:
\begin{eqnarray}
 \mu^{\rm 4-cube} & = & 0.7776656535 ...    \label{eq:4-cube}, \\
 \mu^{\rm 4-cube} & = & 0.8785309152 ...     \label{eq:5-cube}.
\end{eqnarray}

The variance does not seem to be given in closed form ...
