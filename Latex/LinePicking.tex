\section{Introduction}

The {\em line-picking} problem is a standard problem in stochastic
geometry, where we pick lines at random from some region. The typical
questions one asks are what will then mean line length be? What will
the Probability Density Function (PDF) be?

This brief note describes the current list of known PDFs, and where
they were derived, as well as the current set of code to calculate
these. 

The code is written in C with minimal external dependencies, and with
suitable wrapper functions for Matlab and R, to allow it to be run on
a wide variety of systems.



Motivation: examples of uses
\begin{itemize}

\item Modelling a PNNI hierarchical routing protocol for ATM packet
  telecommunication networks~\cite{Rosenberg200499} (length of lines
  in rectangles);

\item 

\end{itemize}

Apart from a systematic survey of the line-picking problem, we have
made several contributions in this paper:
\begin{itemize}

\item For many line-picking problems, there have been works that
  determined the Probability Density Function (PDF), or Cumulative
  Density Function (CDF), or just mean and/or variance. It should be
  clear that give either the PDF or CDF the other quantities are all
  obtainable numerically, however, we primarily focus here on
  closed-form solutions, and we have provided such for many of the
  currently absent cases, e.g., the CDF for the rectangle line-picking
  problem. 

\item We have extended the circle and sphere line-picking problems to
  the $n$-sphere.

\item We have extended the line-picking problem onto addition regions,
  in particular the cylinder, ...

\item We have extended the line-picking problem to consider different
  notions of distance: for example, the Manhattanor the $L_{\infty}$
  distance on the rectangle.

\item We have extended the line-picking problem to geodesics on
  certain surfaces, notable the cylinder and $n$-sphere.

\end{itemize}



\section{Problem Definition}

Although, commonly called the ``line-picking'' problem, the problem is
more often motivated in practical problems (such as those described
above), by the problem of finding the distance between two random
points. 

This is a much better way to describe the problem. It avoids
Bertrand's paradox, where (at least) three methods of choosing a chord
of a circle at random leads to confusion and a ``paradox''.
% http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167637703000725
% http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_paradox_%28probability%29
So here we shall focus on lines determined by two IID end-points, but
we shall generalize the problem substantially to motivate by the
practical problems discussed above.

We define a {\em line-picking problem} to consists of 3 components:
\begin{itemize}

\item Some space $\Omega$ (typically a subset of $R^n$), on which we
  draw independent pairs of random points.

\item The measure $\mu$ on $\Omega$ giving the probability of drawing
  points from given segments of $\Omega$. The most common measure, by
  far, is the uniform measure, resulting in a generalized Poisson
  process of points on the $\Omega$.

\item A distance metric $D(\cdot, \cdot)$ on the space $\Omega$. One
  way to think of this is we are drawing ``lines'', i.e., geodesics,
  in some space $\Sigma$ in which $\Omega$ is embedded. The most
  common case is that the space $\Sigma = \R^n$, and the distance
  metric is simple Euclidean distance. In this case, the geodesics are
  simple lines -- hence the name of the problem. However, there are
  other possibilities.

\end{itemize}
We describe these problems by the triple: $\big(\Omega, \mu, D(\cdot,
\cdot)\big)$. However, the common cases are so common that we ommit
mentioning that the measure is uniform, or that the distance metric is
Given that the typical case of $\mu$ is uniform, and of $d$ is
Euclidean, we ommit these from the problem statement when we use these
simple defaults.

Figure~\ref{fig:eg} presents three examples: the disk-line-picking
problem, the circle-line-picking problem and the cube-line-picking
problem.

\section{General Properties}
\label{sec:general}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Most of the cases are defined over finite regions, and hence the
  PDFs have finite support.

\item All of the distributions are {\em proper}

\item Almost all are defined on continuous, convex sets, and in this
  case the distributions are continuous, i.e., the CDF is a continuous
  function.

\item Almost all are defined on continuous, convex sets, and in this
  case the PDFs are also continuous functions.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Region Transforms}
\label{sec:scaling}

Many of the standard problems use a uniform point distribution and
Euclidean distances on some convex region of $R^n$. In these cases,
there is are easy scaling and trasnlation laws that means once we know
the distribution for some size region, we can compute it for any size.

Translation is trivial. Given the uniform distribution of point,
translation has no affect on the line-length distribution.

Scaling is almost as simple: if the region $\Omega$ is scaled in all
dimensions by $L$, then the problem is identical under a scaling of
the distance metric by $L$. We can therefore scale the density
functions as follows
\begin{equation}
   g_L(t) = \frac{1}{L} g_1 \left( \frac{t}{L} \right). 
\end{equation}
Non-uniform scaling is not so simple as we shall see in the results
below.

Scaling for CDFs is even simpler, we simply take
\begin{equation}
   G_L(t) = G_1 \left( \frac{t}{L} \right). 
\end{equation}


\section{Examples}
\label{sec:known}

We go through a list of examples, some from the literature, and some
derived here, though derivations are typically delayed until the
appendices in order to make the flow easy.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}


limit n large for various spherical cases

  -- approach Gaussian, distances are farish apart

  -- use to model distances between images

If distances are all similar as they seem to be, then Waxman
approaches ER graph
