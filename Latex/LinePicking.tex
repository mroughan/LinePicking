\section{Introduction}

The {\em line-picking} problem is a standard problem in stochastic
geometry, where we pick lines at random from some region. The typical
questions one asks are what will then mean line length be? What will
the Probability Density Function (PDF) be?

This brief note describes the current list of known PDFs, and where
they were derived, as well as the current set of code to calculate
these. 

The code is written in C with minimal external dependencies, and with
suitable wrapper functions for Matlab and R, to allow it to be run on
a wide variety of systems.



Motivation: examples of uses
\begin{itemize}

\item Modelling a PNNI hierarchical routing protocol for ATM packet
  telecommunication networks~\cite{Rosenberg200499} (length of lines
  in rectangles);

\item 

\end{itemize}

\section{Problem Definition}

A fairly general formulation of the {\em line-picking problem}
consists of 3 components:
\begin{itemize}

\item Some space $\Omega$ (typically a subset of $R^n$), on which we
  draw pairs of random points.

\item The measure $\mu$ on $\Omega$ giving the probability of drawing
  points from given segments of $\Omega$. The most common measure, by
  far, is the uniform measure, resulting in a generalized Poisson
  process of points on the $\Omega$.

\item A distance metric $D(\cdot, \cdot)$ on the space $\Omega$. One
  way to think of this is we are drawing ``lines'', i.e., geodesics,
  in some space $\Sigma$ in which $\Omega$ is embedded. The most
  common case is that the space $\Sigma = \R^n$, and the distance
  metric is simple Euclidean distance. In this case, the geodesics are
  simple lines -- hence the name of the problem. However, there are
  other possibilities.

\end{itemize}
We describe these problems by the triple: $\big(\Omega, \mu, D(\cdot,
\cdot)\big)$. However, the common cases are so common that we ommit
mentioning that the measure is uniform, or that the distance metric is
Given that the typical case of $\mu$ is uniform, and of $d$ is
Euclidean, we ommit these from the problem statement when we use these
simple defaults.

There are other possibilities. In the formulation above, a line is
defined by its two independently chosen end points, but there are
choice of a random line could mean other things. For instance,
Bertrand's paradox involves chosing a chord of a circle at random, and
he presents three methods for doing so: one by choosing random end
points, and two others involving more involved constructions.

% http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_paradox_%28probability%29
However, here we shall focus on lines determined by two IID
end-points. 

Figure~\ref{fig:eg} presents three examples: the disk-line-picking
problem, the circle-line-picking problem and the cube-line-picking
problem.

Given one ofthese problems, there have been works that determined the
Probability Density Function (PDF), or Cumulative Density Function
(CDF), or just mean and/or variance. It should be clear that give
either the PDF or CDF the other quantities are all obtainable
numerically, however, we primarily focus here on closed-form
solutions. 


\section{General Properties}
\label{sec:general}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Most of the cases are defined over finite regions, and hence the
  PDFs have finite support.

\item All of the distributions are {\em proper}

\item Almost all are defined on continuous, convex sets, and in this
  case the distributions are continuous, i.e., the CDF is a continuous
  function.

\item Almost all are defined on continuous, convex sets, and in this
  case the PDFs are also continuous functions.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Region Transforms}
\label{sec:scaling}

Many of the standard problems use a uniform point distribution and
Euclidean distances on some convex region of $R^n$. In these cases,
there is are easy scaling and trasnlation laws that means once we know
the distribution for some size region, we can compute it for any size.

Translation is trivial. Given the uniform distribution of point,
translation has no affect on the line-length distribution.

Scaling is almost as simple: if the region $\Omega$ is scaled in all
dimensions by $L$, then the problem is identical under a scaling of
the distance metric by $L$. We can therefore scale the density
functions as follows
\begin{equation}
   g_L(t) = \frac{1}{L} g_1 \left( \frac{t}{L} \right). 
\end{equation}
Non-uniform scaling is not so simple as we shall see in the results
below.

Scaling for CDFs is even simpler, we simply take
\begin{equation}
   G_L(t) = G_1 \left( \frac{t}{L} \right). 
\end{equation}

\section{Examples}
\label{sec:known}

We go through a list of examples, some from the literature, and some
derived here, though derivations are typically delayed until the
appendices in order to make the flow easy.
