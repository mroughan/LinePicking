\section{Introduction}

The {\em line-picking} problem is a standard problem in stochastic
geometry, where we pick lines at random from some region. The typical
questions one asks are what will then mean line length be? What will
the Probability Density Function (PDF) be?

This brief note describes the current list of known PDFs, and where
they were derived, as well as the current set of code to calculate
these. 

The code is written in C with minimal external dependencies, and with
suitable wrapper functions for Matlab and R, to allow it to be run on
a wide variety of systems.



Motivation: examples of uses
\begin{itemize}

\item Modelling a PNNI hierarchical routing protocol for ATM packet
  telecommunication networks~\cite{Rosenberg200499} (length of lines
  in rectangles);

\item 

\end{itemize}

\section{Problem Definition}

Start with a space $\Omega$, from which we can draw points $x$ at
random. Typical examples include a rectangle in $R^2$, or a hyperball
in $R^n$.

Draw two IID (Independently, Identically Distributed) points from the
space, and draw a line between the points. The line could refer to the
natural geodesic on the space, or something more complicated such as
a geodesic in a higher dimensional Euclidean space in which $\Omega$
is embedded. For instance, we might consider simple straight lines
between points chosen in a rectangle, or straight lines in $R^n$
between points chosen on the surface of a sphere, or geodesics on the
surface of the same sphere.

Another way to frame this is to assume we have a distance metic
$d(\cdot, \cdot)$ on the space $\Omega$. The typical distance metric
used in these problems is the Euclidean distance, but others are
possible.

So a {\em line-picking problem} consists of 3 components:
\begin{itemize}

\item $\Omega$ (typically a subset of $R^n$)

\item The measure $\mu$ on $\Omega$ describing the choice of points
  (typically uniform)

\item The space in which we draw lines (geodesics) and its related
  distance metric.

\end{itemize}
so we describe these problems by the triple: $(\Omega, \mu, d)$. Given
that the typical case of $\mu$ is uniform, and of $d$ is Euclidean, we
often ommit these from the problem statement.

length exceeding the length of a side of an inscribed equilateral

\section{Region Transforms}
\label{sec:scaling}

Many of the standard problems use a uniform point distribution and
Euclidean distances on some convex region of $R^n$. In these cases,
there is are easy scaling and trasnlation laws that means once we know
the distribution for some size region, we can compute it for any size.

Translation is trivial. Given the uniform distribution of point,
translation has no affect on the line-length distribution.

Scaling is almost as simple: if the region $\Omega$ is scaled in all
dimensions by $L$, then the problem is identical under a scaling of
the distance metric by $L$. We can therefore scale the density
functions as follows
\begin{equation}
   g_L(t) = \frac{1}{L} g_1 \left( \frac{t}{L} \right). 
\end{equation}
Non-uniform scaling is not so simple as we shall see in the results
below.

Scaling for CDFs is even simpler, we simply take
\begin{equation}
   G_L(t) = G_1 \left( \frac{t}{L} \right). 
\end{equation}



\section{Examples}
\label{sec:known}

We go through a list of examples, some from the literature, and some
derived here, though derivations are typically delayed until the
appendices in order to make the flow easy.

\subsection{Extensions}

These results have also been extended into 3D, with the probability
density function of distances between two (uniformly) randomly chosen
points in the unit cube is given in
\cite{mathai99:_distan,weisstein:_cube_line_picking}, by a yet more
complicated, but again easily evaluated formula. Likewise the formula
have been calculated for a box (with sides $a,b$ and
$c$)~\cite{philip:_probab_distr_distan_between_two} and 4- and
5-Cubes~\cite{philip:_probab_distr_distan_between_two_4d}. Other
results are also known, for instance the distribution when the points
are chosen on the sides of the square (but lines are drawn across it)
or faces of a cube!\cite{mathai99:_distan}, and the distribution of
distances between points chosen in two different
rectangles~\cite{b.ghosh51:_random_rect}.

Rosenberg~\cite{Rosenberg200499} derives a similar result to the mean
line length in a rectangle, but under different assumptions of the
random selection of lines (he assumes we first choose a random angle,
then choose the line).
