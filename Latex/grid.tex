\subsection{Grid-line picking}
\label{sec:grid_line}

The grid-line picking problem takes points at random from a finite
grid, e.g., the integer points within a rectangle,
\[ \Z^{a,b} = \big\{ (x,y) \in \Z^2 \; \big| 
                      \; 0 \leq x \leq b \mbox{ and } 0 \leq y \leq a
              \big\},
\]
where $a, b \in \Z^+$.

Perhaps the most natural choice of metric here is the Manhattan
distance, but we could also approach the problem for the Euclidean
distance.

This is an unusual case, in comparison to those above in that the
distribution is not continuous.
