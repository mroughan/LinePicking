\subsection{$n$D-Sphere-geodesic-line picking}
\label{sec:nsphere_geodesic_line}

Can we do this case in general ???

$n$-Sphere is embedded in $\R^{n+1}$ and encloses the $n+1$-ball

Obviously, the sphere has spherical symmetry, but as a result, we can,
without loss of generality, assume the first point lies at the pole of
the sphere.
