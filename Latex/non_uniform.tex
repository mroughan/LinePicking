\subsection{Nonuniform line picking example}
\label{sec:nonuniform_line}

An example of a non-uniform case, perhaps Gaussian distribution on nD
with infinite region?

Just to illustrate the concept





\subsubsection{PDF}

difference of two IID Gaussians, will be a mean zero Gaussian, with 2xVariance

sqrt of sum of squares of Gaussians gives a Rayleigh distribution

should give general results for this case
