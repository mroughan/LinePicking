\subsection{Other examples involving rectangles}
\label{sec:rect_other}

In the problem formulation at the start of this paper we described the
line-picking problem as one where a line was chosen by choosing two
random points, independently, and drawing a ``line'' between them.  In
fact, some people interpret the idea of selecting a random line
differently.

Rosenberg~\cite{Rosenberg200499} considered the case where we first
choose a random angle, then choose the a random line within a
rectangle, such that it is at the required angle. 




 --- another way to think about it is choosing two points from a
 different space ....
