%           Example:  [ g ] =  LinePickingPDF( t, problem, parameters ) 
% 
% INPUTS:       
%    input argument 1 = t, a vector of points at which to calculate the PDF 
%    input argument 2 = problem, the problem number (See LinePickingPrintAllProblems) 
%    input argument 3 = parameters, the parameters of the problem 
%
%         
% OUTPUTS:
%    output argument 1 = g, a vector containing the values g(t) of the PDF at the points t
